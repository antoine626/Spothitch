Few locals that go that direction have usually completely packed pickups, maybe some will be willing to take you on roof. Problem is the army pressence in Aousserd and frontline before Leyuad. Better don't go there and go to Bir Ganduz. Although if you don't want to visit towns and don't want to go to Mauritania before Aousserd there is beautiful Ouad al-Jann",
