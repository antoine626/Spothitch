Good country for hitchhicking. I was hicking alot in the mountains and used hitchhiking to get into and between towns. Usually got picked up by pickup-trucks and sad in the truck bed. So, you gotta be okay with that but I never felt unsafe or scared. Never waited very long. 30 minutes, tops.","date":"2024-08-28","rating":5}],"destLat":null,"destLon":null}]}
