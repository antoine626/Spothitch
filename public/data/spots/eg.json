We couldn't communicate in language and the two boys wanted to give me all sorts of possessions of theirs for me to take. I gave them little funky wire men in return. I wanted to give their father some spare cash in return when he fuelled the car and he graciously refused over and over. Extremely kind and generous people. Simple human to human connection.","date":"2014-10-20","rating":5}],"destLat":null,"destLon":null},{"id":1,"lat":30.0505,"lon":31.2331,"rating":5,"reviews":1,"wait":null,"signal":null,"lastUsed":"2025-06-17","comments":[{"text":"Well, hitchhiking in Egypt for faraway places won't just work due to military checkpoints all the ways and they don't let foreigners to specific regions with no planned trip(bus)\r\n\r\nSo the best is to go to GoBus office and get a ticket to wherever you need and it won't cost more than 10 euros.

Then take any microbus (1 EGP) going further South until you reach the highway. There will probably be other people waiting for a bus or shared transport. Just walk a bit further and try to wave down cars. Best to take the highway El-Karimat El-Zafrana.
