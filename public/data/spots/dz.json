The owner told me go up to the mosque, turn right, walk straight up to the main road. I started hitchhiking and walked till the end of the houses so a man picked me up and drove till tunisian border. My third and last solo hitchhike within 2 months in Algeria.\r\nI truly hope to inspire many nomads to try experience this huge country!",

So you can walk here and wait from the gas station side under trees shadow. If it doesn't work, take a minibus back to the city and move into a departing one. Cost 150da (60cent).\r\nThis was my first hitchhike try within 2 months around Algeria.",
