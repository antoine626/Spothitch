Faroese people are ultra super mega friendly and speak very good English, mostly. The land is mesmerizing! :) [AdrianB]","date":"2019-08-23","rating":5},{"text":"Hitchhiked March 2015 with 3 friends. Sometimes all of us got a ride in the same car, and even when splitting in couples we arrived at the same time since the road network is limited (but excellent) and distances are short. Safe, fast, easy and friendly people that speak English well. Biggest issue is the weather, but as long as you're prepared no worries!","date":"2015-05-29","rating":5},{"text":"I hitched most of the Faroe Islands in 2005. Contender for the easiest hitching in the world! Often the first car would pull over, often just one ride would get you there as distances are short.

Not much traffic, but very friendly people. Somehow everybody will ask you if you're Russian, as apparently only Russians hitch here (?).
